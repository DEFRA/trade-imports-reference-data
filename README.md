### Docker Compose

A Docker Compose template is in [compose.yml](compose.yml).

A local environment with:

- Localstack for AWS services (S3, SQS)
- Redis
- MongoDB
- This service.
- A commented out frontend example.

```bash
docker compose --profile services up --build -d
```

A more extensive setup is available in [github.com/DEFRA/cdp-local-environment](https://github.com/DEFRA/cdp-local-environment)

### MongoDB

#### MongoDB via Docker

Run infrastructure services (MongoDB, Localstack, Redis):

```bash
docker compose --profile infra up -d
```

#### MongoDB locally

Alternatively install MongoDB locally:

- Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/#installation) on your local machine
- Start MongoDB:
```bash
sudo mongod --dbpath ~/mongodb-cdp
```

#### MongoDB in CDP environments

In CDP environments a MongoDB instance is already set up
and the credentials exposed as enviromment variables.


### Inspect MongoDB

To inspect the Database and Collections locally:
```bash
mongosh
```

You can use the CDP Terminal to access the environments' MongoDB.

### Testing

Run the tests with:

Tests run by running a full Spring Boot application backed by [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/).
Tests do not use mocking of any sort and read and write from the containerized database.

```bash
mvn test
```

### Running

Run the application:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### SonarCloud

Example SonarCloud configuration are available in the GitHub Action workflows.

### Dependabot

We have added an example dependabot configuration file to the repository. You can enable it by renaming
the [.github/example.dependabot.yml](.github/dependabot.yml) to `.github/dependabot.yml`
